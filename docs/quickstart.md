# Quickstart Guide

This guide walks you through setting up miniMDM and managing your first master data object in under 10 minutes.

## 1. Start miniMDM

Follow the [installation guide](installation.md) then run:

```bash
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. You will be redirected to the login page.

On first run, a default admin account is created automatically:

| Username | Password |
|---|---|
| `admin` | `admin` |

Log in and immediately change the password via **Users** in the header navigation.

## 2. Define Your Data Model

Create `config/minimdm.yaml`:

```yaml
minimdm:
  schemas:
    mycompany:
      objects:
        supplier:
          name: Supplier
          description: External suppliers
          attributes:
            code:
              name: Supplier Code
              type: string
              required: true
            name:
              name: Supplier Name
              type: string
              required: true
            country:
              name: Country
              type: string
            email:
              name: Contact Email
              type: email
```

Restart the server (or call `POST /api/config/reload` if you want zero downtime).

## 3. Add Records

Navigate to **mycompany → Supplier** in the sidebar. Click **+ New record** and fill in the form.

Alternatively, use the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/records/mycompany/supplier \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"S001","name":"Acme Ltd","country":"US","_reason":"Initial load"}'
```

## 4. Bulk Import

Prepare a CSV file `suppliers.csv`:

```csv
code,name,country,email
S001,Acme Ltd,US,acme@example.com
S002,Globex Corp,DE,info@globex.example
```

Import via the UI: on the object list page select **Insert only** (or choose an attribute to upsert on) from the dropdown next to the **Import** button, then click **Import** and pick the file.

To upsert (update existing records instead of always inserting), select the matching attribute in the dropdown. Rows whose value for that attribute matches an existing record are updated; unmatched rows are inserted as new records. The response shows separate inserted and updated counts.

Import via the API:

```bash
# Insert only
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/records/mycompany/supplier/import?format=csv" \
  -F "file=@suppliers.csv"

# Upsert on 'code'
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/records/mycompany/supplier/import?format=csv&upsert_key=code" \
  -F "file=@suppliers.csv"
```

> **Note:** import files must be UTF-8 encoded. If Excel is your source, save as "CSV UTF-8" rather than plain "CSV" or "Unicode Text" — see `docs/troubleshooting.md` if you hit an encoding error.

## 5. Search and Browse

Use the search bar on the object list page to filter records. Results update as you type.

To view soft-deleted records, check the **Show deleted** checkbox in the toolbar. Deleted rows appear with a strikethrough style and link directly to their history page, where they can be reverted.

## 6. View History and Revert

Click any row in the record list to open the detail page, then click **History** to see all versions. Click **Revert** next to any version to restore it.

## 7. Export Data

Click **Export CSV**, **Export TSV**, or **Export JSON** on the list page.

## 8. Audit Log

The full audit log is available in the UI at **Audit Log** in the header (admin only), or via the API:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/audit?schema=mycompany&obj=supplier
```
